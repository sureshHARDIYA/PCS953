# PCS953

This exercise is open-ended, its main purpose is to learn about model and/or graph transformations. Hence, it is not important which tool or approach you pick to solve the problem(s), and it is not important which problem(s) you pick to solve.

The website https://www.transformation-tool-contest.eu (Lenker til eit ekstern omr책de.)Lenker til eit ekstern omr책de. presents at least 11 cases (or problems) which you can try to solve. You should have time to solve one of the cases during the study week. Of course, you will find the solutions on the website, but I trust you only use the solution as a guide and perhaps only at the end to make sure that your solution is acceptable.

We encourage (one of) two kinds of solutions in this exercise:

choose a suitable transformation tool and solve an existing case
make an overall review of which tools and approaches are used in earlier solutions and how do they compare with each other
I would like all of you to have a look at this paper https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10270-018-0665-6 (Lenker til eit ekstern omr책de.)Lenker til eit ekstern omr책de. for more information about existing transformation tools and approaches.

You can work in groups of up to 2 students, or work alone if you prefer so. Mixture of master+phd students is encouraged. 

**Requirements:**

- Each group will get a time slot of approximately 20 minutes on Tuesday 5th March to demonstrate and present the results.
- We also expect a short report (2-3 pages) on the solution submitted to Canvas. Explain clearly which case you have chosen, from which year, and which approach you have chosen to solve the case.
- The report must include a link to the source code of your solution on a git repository. NB! You can skip this in case you have chosen a theoretical exercise on making an overview of previous solutions.
- The presentation slides of the demo should be submitted to Canvas latest on Tuesday 5th March.
